# react-boilerplate üê∞
Minimal React Boilerplate. Ready with react-router v4, redux, and styled-components (routing and theming in redux store)

hop into programming faster (haha just an excuse to put a cool rabbit in the title)

# Get Started

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/roball24/react-boilerplate.git
```

2. Install yarn (faster package manager than npm) or just use npm
```
brew install yarn (MacOS)
```

3. install node modules (dependencies for your app)
```
cd /'path-to-directory'/react-boilerplate/
'yarn install' or 'npm install'
```

4. Run Boilerplate For Local Development
```
'yarn start' or 'npm start'
```

5. Build Project for Production
```
'yarn build' or 'npm run build'
```

## Design Decisions

1.) styled-components

2.) react-router-redux

3.) thunk-middleware

4.) injecting theme in redux

Webdev made better with React! I'd love to hear if anything is made with this!!
